## Overview
One Paragraph of project description goes here


## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Instalation
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

#### Labels:
* `Product Backlog`: contains user stories derived from project requirements
* Every user story has a label for its importance according to the MoSCoW method
* `Sprint backlog`: contains tasks derived from user stories for a specific sprint
* The labels `application::collection` and `application::dissemination` refer to the two parts of our project (*Data collection* and *Data dissemination*)


#### Board:
* Each sprint will have a separate board
* A user story will be assigned to a sprint (milestone) 
* `Sprint Backlog` list will contain tasks derived from a user story
